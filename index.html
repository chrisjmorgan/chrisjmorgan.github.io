                           On the LGS project, I worked in a team utilizing SCRUM methodology to design and build a cross platform mobile application using the codename one framework. 
                        
                        </li>
                        <li>The LGS app was built to assist in the designing and simulating of digital logic circuits.</li>
                        <li>
                          My role in the project was to conceptionalize the UI design and implement certain logic circuits.

                        <li>
                          In terms of functional correctness and usefulness, our product much exceeded comparable programs.

                          The RPN Calculator app was programmed in Java using the codename one framework.

                       <li>
                          The app was designed to emulate an typical reverse polish notation calculator but without the hardware limitations (finite stack).

                       <li>
                          My role within the group was implement key business logic operations in addition to overall UI design in using codename one's css integration.

                              This program goes through four main stages. First, it gets the next command from stdin. Next, it parses the string and organizes the data in a command struct.
                              That struct is then used to execute. Finally, the return of the executed programs are collected and printed to stdout.
